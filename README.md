loggy - sample node.js server that does a lot of logging
================================================================================

This is a sample application cloned from IBM showing how to handle logging on Cloud Foundry
with node.js.  There's an article available, discussing the application,
here:

hacking
================================================================================

This project uses [cake](http://coffeescript.org/#cake) as it's
build tool.  To rebuild the project continuously, use the command

    npm run watch

Other `cake` commands are available (assuming you are using npm v2) with
the command

    npm run cake -- <command here>

Run `npm run cake` to see the other commands available in the `Cakefile`.
